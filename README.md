Check signature of your release
====
This portion is a guide to help you identify if your apk is an official release from
MobileGlues dev.

In your Android build-tools, find `apksigner`. Then run the following command:
```bash
apksigner verify --print-certs path/to/MobileGlues-plugin.apk
```

It should print out:
```bash
Signer #1 certificate DN: CN=MGDev, OU=MGDev, O=MGDev, L=Unknown, ST=Unknown, C=CN
Signer #1 certificate SHA-256 digest: 324f4efaff81632373dec9bc714a904b64740249410b551b61805340e42ff5d5
Signer #1 certificate SHA-1 digest: 615bc8b2741c24e7e5847b0c5c1d6816d5b0763a
Signer #1 certificate MD5 digest: 320ede9d22c709fe3792c804d5e00153
```

Check whether the `certificate DN` and `certificate digest` portion matches exactly like above.

In order that you may want to check against public key file, `pub.cer` and `pub.pem` are also provided.
You can use your utility as you like to check your apk against those files.
